# Advent Of Code 2018 - Leo Feldman's Answers

Hey all, I am participating in the Advent of Code 2018 challenge in order to brush up on my ability to solve problems and write algorithms!  My solutions will generally be written with C#, but I am also looking to use this challenge to get some experience writing with a different language (looking at Go, Ruby.)

## Language used to solve problem initially
Day 1 - C#\
Day 2 - C#\
Day 3 - C#\
Day 4 - C#\
Day 5 - C#\
Day 6 - C#\
Day 7 - C#\
Day 8 - C#\
Day 9 - Go\
Day 10 - Java
